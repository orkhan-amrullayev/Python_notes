#########################
modelling
#########################
create error metrics and show scores functions
create run_model2 kind of custom functions


running a few algorithms on whole training dataset
measure score

dividing train set into smaller train and validation sets
fit on training set and test the validation set

# Grid Search CV 1
take the best parameters, if they are on the boundaries, use second grid search again with the parameters beyond the boundaries

# Load test set
use custom function created to clean&prepare it as it was for training set

use best model with best estimators on test dataset

join test dataset with index or id or whatever

save the prediction
